What is the project about?
 My project is about a website that sells lamps. I'm making it as much responsive as I can.

How is this project beneficial?
 My code is modular, and I have comments organizing it as much as possible. I'm using the best approaches possible, still learning, and reading some articles. 
 It's only my 5th project, so there might be some problems I don't see yet.

How can users use this?
 I put notes as much as possible so people know where everything is. This project is the biggest one I've done so far, so I hope I'm giving a lot to the community. I'm doing this as a tutorial, and I don't mind people using it as their own. 
 The teacher of this project had some issues and some approaches that weren't the best. The more I do projects, the more I change them for the better. I would hope people learn from me and help me too.

Where can I find help with the project?
 If anyone has doubts about the project, you can ask me directly. I don't mind explaining.
